It is commonly used in astronomical and religious contexts to denote a ritual act of giving or offering something to a deity.\n\n\n2. **Contradictions:** The context of \"wu\" is unclear. While it could potentially indicate a territorial boundary, it is not consistent with the other context where it appears.\n\n\n3. **Confidence adjustment:** The confidence is medium for \"qoq\" due to the lack of clear contextual evidence. However, the low confidence for \"wu\" suggests that its meaning may be more ambiguous.\n\n\n**Suggested reinterpretation:**\n\nThe word \"qoq\" likely refers to a specific type of water offering, such as an astronomical offering or a religious ritual offering to a deity. The context of \"wu\" is unclear and could potentially indicate a different meaning.",
