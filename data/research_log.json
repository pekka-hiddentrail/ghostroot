    "summary": "Thinking...\nWe are given two recent artifacts (the most recent last) from two branches: branch_a and branch_b.\n Both have the same token: \"Thinking...\" (but note: the token count for each branch is 1, and the top token is \"thinking\")\n\n However, note: the evidence summary shows:\n   branch_b: token_count=1, top_tokens=['thinking']\n   branch_a: token_count=1, top_tokens=['thinking']\n\n So both branches have one inscription that says \"Thinking...\" (with a trailing ellipsis, but we can ignore the punctuation for the purpose of the root).\n\n Important: We are reconstructing a proto-language from these descendant inscriptions.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Identify 2–5 possible cognate sets across descendant languages.\n\n    We have only two branches (branch_a and branch_b) and each has one token: \"thinking\".\n\n    Since we have only two tokens (both the same string), we can only form one set of cognates? But note: the problem says \"across descendant languages\". We have two languages here: branch_a and branch_b.\n\n    However, the evidence is very limited. We don't have more languages. So we can only form one cognate set: the word for \"thinking\" in both branches.\n\n    But the problem asks for 2-5 cognate sets. Since we don: we have only one set? Let's see.\n\n    Alternative: maybe the token \"thinking\" is the same in both, so we have one set.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"imperfect evidence\". We have only two artifacts and they are identical.\n\n    Proposed cognate set: \n        [branch_a: \"thinking\", branch_b: \"thinking\"]\n\n    But wait: the problem says \"similar-looking words\". Since they are identical, they are similar.\n\n    We can only form one set? But the problem says 2-5. So we have to be cautious.\n\n    Let me re-read: the evidence summary shows two branches. We don't have more branches. So we have only one set.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"Identify 2–5 possible cognate sets\". We have to say that we have only one set? But the problem asks for 2-5. So we must be explicit about uncertainty.\n\n    I think the safe approach is to say:\n\n        We have only two descendant languages (branch_a and branch_b) and both have the same token \"thinking\". Therefore, we can only identify one cognate set.\n\n        But to meet the requirement of 2-5, we might have to say that we don't have enough evidence to form more sets. However, the problem says \"possible\" cognate sets. So we can only form one.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the token \"thinking\" might be a loanword or a common word, but without more evidence we can't form more.\n\n        Let's do:\n\n          Cognate set 1: \n            branch_a: \"thinking\" (meaning: to think)\n            branch_b: \"thinking\" (meaning: to think)\n\n        And we cannot form more because we have no other tokens.\n\n        But the problem says \"2–5\". Since we don't have more evidence, we'll state that we have only one set and note the uncertainty.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Be cautious and explicit about uncertainty\".\n\n        So I will write:\n\n          Possible cognate sets (only one set available due to limited evidence):\n            1. [branch_a: \"thinking\", branch_b: \"thinking\"]\n\n        But the problem asks for 2-5. So we have to say that we don't have enough evidence to form more than one.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think of the word as being in two different forms? But they are the same.\n\n        I think the answer is one set.\n\n 2. Propose up to 3 proto-root hypotheses.\n\n    We have one word in two branches: \"thinking\". We don't have more context.\n\n    We can try to reconstruct a proto-root for the word \"thinking\".\n\n    But note: the word \"thinking\" in English is a verb. However, in the inscriptions, it's written as \"Thinking...\" (with a capital T? but we don't know the writing system). We have to be cautious.\n\n    We don't know the language of the inscriptions. They are in branch_a and branch_b, which are descendant languages of the proto-language.\n\n    We have to hypothesize a proto-root that could have led to \"thinking\" in both.\n\n    However, without more evidence, it's very hard.\n\n    Let's consider:\n\n      In Proto-Indo-European, there is a root for \"think\": *dʰeǵʰno- (but that's a stretch because we don't know the family).\n\n      But we don't know the language family of branch_a and branch_b.\n\n    Given the context: the inscriptions are from tomb offerings and short prayers. They are likely to be from a language that is part of a family that has been lost.\n\n    We have to be cautious.\n\n    Hypotheses:\n\n      Option 1: Proto-root: *thiŋk- (meaning: to think) -> but this is a guess.\n\n      Option 2: Proto-root: *sōn- (meaning: to think) -> but this is also a guess.\n\n      However, without any context, we cannot be sure.\n\n    We have to be explicit about low confidence.\n\n    Proposed:\n\n      *thiŋk- = to think (confidence: low)   [because we have only one word in two branches and they are identical]\n\n      *sōn- = to think (confidence: low)      [another possibility?]\n\n      *dʰeǵʰno- = to think (confidence: very low) [but this is from PIE, which we don't know if it's relevant]\n\n    But note: the problem says \"up to 3\". We'll do 2.\n\n 3. Note 1–3 open questions.\n\n    Open questions:\n\n      a. What is the actual meaning of the word in the inscriptions? (We have only one token: \"thinking\", but it might be a verb or a noun? Also, the context: tomb offering label and short prayer fragment. In the tomb, it might be a verb for the act of thinking in the context of the offering? But we don't know.)\n\n      b. How did the word evolve to become \"thinking\" in both branches? (We have only two branches and they are identical, so it's unlikely that the word is a loan. But without more evidence, we don't know.)\n\n      c. Are there other words in the descendant languages that we haven't seen? (We have only two artifacts and each has one token. We need more data to find more cognates.)\n\n      d. What is the language family of branch_a and branch_b? (This is critical for reconstruction.)\n\n    We'll pick 2-3.\n\n    Let's write:\n\n        Open questions:\n          1. What is the precise meaning of the word \"thinking\" in the context of these inscriptions? (e.g., is it a verb, a noun, or a specific ritual term?)\n          2. What is the historical relationship between branch_a and branch_b? (Are they sister languages or part of a larger family?)\n          3. Are there other tokens in the descendant languages that could form additional cognate sets?\n\n    But note: the problem says \"1–3\".\n\n    We'll do 2 to be safe.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Open questions:\n          1. Is the word \"thinking\" a direct descendant of a single proto-root, or did it undergo independent borrowing in both branches?\n          2. What is the original meaning of the proto-root? (Without more context, we cannot be sure.)\n          3. Are there more inscriptions in branch_a and branch_b that we can analyze?\n\n    However, the problem says: \"Note 1–3 open questions to investigate next.\"\n\n    I think the first two are critical.\n\n    Let's write:\n\n        Open questions:\n          1. What is the historical relationship between branch_a and branch_b? (We have only two branches and they are identical in this token, but we don't know if they are related or not.)\n          2. Are there other tokens in the descendant languages that could form cognate sets? (We have only one token per branch.)\n          3. What is the meaning of the word in the context of the inscriptions? (e.g., tomb offering label: does it mean \"the thought\" or \"to think\" in the ritual context?)\n\n    But note: the problem says \"open questions to investigate next\". So we want questions that we can answer with more data.\n\n    I'll go with:\n\n        Open questions:\n          1. What is the language family of branch_a and branch_b?\n          2. Are there additional inscriptions in branch_a and branch_b that contain different tokens?\n          3. What is the semantic context of the word \"thinking\" in the inscriptions? (e.g., is it a verb or a noun?)\n\n    However, the problem says: \"Be cautious and explicit about uncertainty\".\n\n    We must not claim certainty.\n\n    Let's structure the output.\n\n    Format:\n\n        # Cognate Sets\n        [list]\n\n        # Proto-Root Hypotheses\n        *root = gloss (confidence)\n\n        # Open Questions\n        [list]\n\n    We have to be short.\n\n    Proposed output:\n\n        # Cognate Sets\n        1. [branch_a: \"thinking\", branch_b: \"thinking\"] (only one set available due to limited evidence)\n\n        # Proto-Root Hypotheses\n        *thiŋk- = to think (confidence: low)\n        *sōn- = to think (confidence: low)\n\n        # Open Questions\n        1. What is the language family of branch_a and branch_b?\n        2. Are there additional tokens in the descendant languages beyond the current evidence?\n        3. What is the semantic context of the word \"thinking\" in the inscriptions?\n\n    But note: the problem says \"Do NOT claim certainty\". So we use \"low\" confidence.\n\n    Also, the problem says: \"Use plain text with headings\".\n\n    Let me write it in plain text.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"Prefer short, structured output\".\n\n    I'll write:\n\n        # Cognate Sets\n        - Set 1: [branch_a: \"thinking\", branch_b: \"thinking\"] (only one cognate set identified; evidence is minimal)\n\n        # Proto-Root Hypotheses\n        *thiŋk- = to think (confidence: low)\n        *sōn- = to think (confidence: low)\n\n        # Open Questions\n        1. What is the language family of branch_a and branch_b?\n        2. Are there additional inscriptions in branch_a and branch_b that contain different tokens?\n        3. What is the semantic context of the word \"thinking\" in the inscriptions?\n\n    Why two hypotheses? Because we want up to 3. We have two.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"up to 3\". We are doing two.\n\n    Also, note: the token is \"Thinking...\" (with a capital T and ellipsis). We are ignoring the punctuation and capitalization. The word is \"thinking\".\n\n    We are cautious: we say \"only one cognate set identified; evidence is minimal\".\n\n    This meets the requirement.\n\n    Let me check the token stats: both branches have one token. So we have only one set.\n\n    We don't have more branches.\n\n    So the output is as above.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"Identify 2–5 possible cognate sets\". We have only one. So we say one set.\n\n    We are explicit about uncertainty.\n\n    I think this is acceptable.\n\n    Let's write it.\n...done thinking.\n\n# Cognate Sets\n- Set 1: [branch_a: \"thinking\", branch_b: \"thinking\"] (only one cognate set identified due to minimal evidence; both branches share identical token with no alternative forms)\n\n# Proto-Root Hypotheses\n*thiŋk- = to think (confidence: low)  \n*sōn- = to think (confidence: low)  \n\n# Open Questions\n1.

A1770216725272: branch_b, inscription, text=\"Thinking...\", context: trade receipt scratched on wood\n\nObservations:\n- Both branches have the word \"Thinking\" (with a trailing ellipsis) in inscriptions. However, note that the word is written in English in the evidence? But the problem states that we are reconstructing a lost proto-language from descendant inscriptions. The text of the inscriptions is given in English? That seems odd.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"You have imperfect evidence.\" and the evidence is given as text in English? But that doesn't make sense for a historical linguist reconstructing a proto-language. \n\nLet me re-read: The evidence summary shows token stats for the descendant languages (branch_a and branch_b) but the tokens are listed as ['thinking']? And the inscriptions are written in English? \n\nThis is confusing. I think the problem might be using a simplified model where the descendant languages are written in English? But that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternative interpretation: The problem might be using a fictional scenario where the descendant languages are represented by tokens that are English words? But the problem says \"descendant inscriptions\", meaning that the inscriptions are in the descendant languages. However, the evidence provided is in English? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"Recent artifacts (most recent last)\" and the text is \"Thinking...\". So it appears that the inscriptions are written in English? But that would be strange because then we wouldn't have a proto-language to reconstruct.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me try to interpret the problem as:\n\nThe problem is set in a fictional scenario where we have two branches (branch_a and branch_b) that are descendant languages of a lost proto-language. The inscriptions in these languages have been transcribed in English? But the problem states that the text is \"Thinking...\". \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using a token-based approach where the tokens are the actual words in the descendant languages, but the problem has written them in English for simplicity? \n\nGiven the constraints, I will assume that the token \"thinking\" is a token that appears in the descendant languages (branch_a and branch_b) and that it is a word that means \"thinking\" in the descendant languages? But that seems odd because the proto-language is lost and we are reconstructing from descendant languages that are written in English? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"reconstructing a lost proto-language from descendant inscriptions\". So the inscriptions are in the descendant languages. The problem has provided the text of the inscriptions in English? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think the problem intends for us to treat the tokens as the actual words in the descendant languages, but they have been transliterated into English for the purpose of this exercise. So we have two descendant languages (branch_a and branch_b) that both have a word that we are calling \"thinking\" (in English) but that word in the descendant language might have been represented by a different set of sounds.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"token stats\" and the top_tokens are ['thinking'] (in English). So it seems the problem is using a simplified model where the descendant languages are represented by English words? \n\nGiven the time, I will proceed with the following:\n\nWe have two branches (branch_a and branch_b) that both have a token \"thinking\" (which we'll take as a word in the descendant language). The problem says the token_count for branch_b is 2 and for branch_a is 1.\n\nWe are to reconstruct a proto-language that had a root that evolved into \"thinking\" in both branches.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"imperfect evidence\". We only have one token in both branches? \n\nLet me try to think of what the proto-root might be.\n\nPossible cognate sets:\n\nWe have only one token in both branches: \"thinking\". So we have one cognate set: [branch_a: \"thinking\", branch_b: \"thinking\"]\n\nBut note: the problem says \"2–5 possible cognate sets\". We only have one set? \n\nHowever, the problem says we have imperfect evidence. We don't have other tokens. So we can only say that there is one cognate set: the word for \"thinking\" in both branches.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"similar-looking words\". We don't have any other words. So we can only report one set.\n\nProposed proto-roots:\n\nWe have to propose up to 3. Since we have only one word, we can only propose one root? But the problem says up to 3.\n\nWe can hypothesize:\n\n1. *thiŋk = \"to think\" (low confidence) because we only have one token in both branches and the token is \"thinking\" (which might be the verb form). But note: the token is written as \"thinking\", which is a present participle? \n\nHowever, the evidence is very limited.\n\nOpen questions:\n\n- Are there other words in the descendant languages that we haven't seen? (We only have one token per branch)\n- What is the exact meaning of the word? (We have only one token: \"thinking\", but in the context of the inscriptions: tomb offering label and short prayer fragment)\n\nBut the problem says: \"Do NOT claim certainty.\"\n\nLet me structure the output:\n\nHeadings:\n1. Cognate sets\n2. Proto-root hypotheses\n3. Open questions\n\nFor cognate sets: \nWe have one set: \n- branch_a: \"thinking\" (appears once)\n- branch_b: \"thinking\" (appears twice)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"similar-looking words\". We don't have any other words. So we report one set.\n\nFor proto-root hypotheses: \nWe can propose:\n1. *thiŋk = \"to think\" (low confidence) - because we have only one token and it's in the context of thinking.\n2. *think = \"to think\" (low confidence) - but this is a bit circular? \n3. *thiŋk- = \"thinking\" (as a gerund) (low confidence)\n\nBut we don't have much evidence. Also, note that the token is written in English as \"thinking\", but in the descendant language it might have been a different word. We don't know.\n\nAlternatively, we can hypothesize that the proto-language had a root that in the descendant languages became \"thinking\". But without more context, it's hard.\n\nGiven the constraints, I'll propose:\n\n1. *thiŋk = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n2. *thiŋk- = \"thinking\" (confidence: low)\n3. *think = \"to think\" (confidence: low)  [but this is a bit too close to the descendant word]\n\nBut note: the problem says \"up to 3\". We can do 2.\n\nOpen questions:\n1. Are there other tokens in the descendant languages that we have not observed? (We only have one token per branch, but the token_count for branch_b is 2, meaning two inscriptions with the token \"thinking\", but we don't know if there are other tokens in the inscriptions)\n2. What is the historical relationship between branch_a and branch_b? (Are they sister branches? Or are they from different proto-languages?)\n3. What is the meaning of the word in the context of the inscriptions? (We have tomb offering and prayer fragments, but without knowing the language, it's hard to say)\n\nBut the problem says: \"Note 1–3 open questions\"\n\nLet me write the output.\n\nImportant: Do not claim certainty. Use plain text with headings.\n\nOutput:\n\n1. Cognate sets\n   - [branch_a: \"thinking\", branch_b: \"thinking\"] (confidence: low)\n\n2. Proto-root hypotheses\n   - *thiŋk = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n   - *thiŋk- = \"thinking\" (confidence: low)\n\n3. Open questions\n   - Are there additional tokens in branch_a and branch_b that could form more cognate sets?\n   - What is the historical relationship between branch_a and branch_b (e.g., are they sister branches or from different proto-languages)?\n   - What is the exact meaning of the word \"thinking\" in the context of the inscriptions (e.g., does it refer to a specific concept in the culture)?\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do NOT claim certainty\". So we use \"low\" for confidence.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"confidence: low/med/high\". We choose low.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"Be cautious and explicit about uncertainty\".\n\nAlso, note: the token is written as \"thinking\" in English. But in the descendant language, it might have been a different word. We don't know. So we have to be cautious.\n\nLet me adjust: we don't know if the word is the same in both branches? But the problem says the top_tokens are both \"thinking\". So we assume it's the same word.\n\nBut the problem says: \"imperfect evidence\". So we have to say it's a possibility.\n\nI think the above is acceptable.\n\nLet me write the output in plain text with headings.\n\nNote: The problem says \"Use plain text with headings\". So:\n\n# Cognate sets\n- [branch_a: \"thinking\", branch_b: \"thinking\"] (confidence: low)\n\n# Proto-root hypotheses\n- *thiŋk = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n- *thiŋk- = \"thinking\" (confidence: low)\n\n# Open questions\n1. Are there additional tokens in branch_a and branch_b that could form more cognate sets?\n2. What is the historical relationship between branch_a and branch_b (e.g., are they sister branches or from different proto-languages)?\n3. What is the exact meaning of the word \"thinking\" in the context of the inscriptions?\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Note 1–3 open questions\". So we list 3.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"Do NOT claim certainty\". We are not claiming certainty, we are just listing questions.\n\nAlso, note: the token \"thinking\" might be a verb in the present participle, but we don't know.\n\nI think this is the best we can do.\n\nLet me check the token counts: branch_b has 2 tokens (both \"thinking\"), branch_a has 1 token (\"thinking\"). So we have two inscriptions for branch_b and one for branch_a.\n\nBut we don't have other words.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nFinal output:\n...done thinking.\n\n# Cognate sets\n- [branch_a: \"thinking\", branch_b: \"thinking\"] (confidence: low)  \n  *Note: Only one shared token observed across both branches; no other words or contexts are available for cross-verification.*\n\n# Proto-root hypotheses\n- *thiŋk = \"to think\" (confidence: low)  \n- *thiŋk- = \"thinking\" (confidence: low)  \n- *thiŋkə = \"thought\" (confidence: low)  \n\n# Open questions\n1.

What is the historical relationship between branch_a and branch_b (e.g., sister branches, separate proto-languages, or divergent paths)? Current data lacks comparative morphology or phonological patterns.\n3. How does the context of the inscriptions (tomb offerings vs. prayer fragments) influence the semantic meaning of \"thinking\" in the proto-language? Without cultural or archaeological context, this remains speculative.",

The token stats show that each branch has 2 tokens and the top token is 'thinking'. \n\nImportant: The evidence is very limited and repetitive. Both branches have the same word \"Thinking\" in their inscriptions. However, note that the word \"Thinking\" is written in English in the evidence, but the inscriptions are in the descendant languages. The problem states that we have \"imperfect evidence\". \n\nGiven the context, it seems that the descendant languages (branch_a and branch_b) both have a word that means \"thinking\" (or a similar concept) but the exact form is not provided in the evidence.

However, the token stats and the text field are in English? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"Recent artifacts (most recent last)\" and the text field is given as 'Thinking...'. But note: the problem states that we are reconstructing a proto-language from descendant inscriptions. The inscriptions are in the descendant languages, so the text field should be the actual words in the descendant languages. However, the evidence shows the text as \"Thinking...\", which is in English. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me re-read: \n\nThe evidence summary: \n  {'branch_b': {'token_count': 2, 'top_tokens': ['thinking']}, ... }\n\nBut the recent artifacts list shows:\n  [ {'id': 'A1770216157901', 'language': 'branch_b', 'type': 'inscription', 'text': 'Thinking...', ... } ]\n\nSo the text field is written in English? That seems odd. Alternatively, the problem might be using \"Thinking\" as a placeholder for the actual word? \n\nGiven the context of the problem, I think the intended meaning is that in the descendant languages (branch_a and branch_b), there is a word that we are observing as \"Thinking\" (but in reality, it's a word in the descendant language that we are representing in English for simplicity). However, the problem says: \"You have imperfect evidence\". \n\nBut note: the token stats show the top token as 'thinking' (lowercase). So in the descendant language, the word is represented by the token 'thinking'. \n\nGiven the very limited evidence (only two tokens in each branch, and both branches have the same token: 'thinking'), we have to work with that.\n\nTask 1: Identify 2–5 possible cognate sets across descendant languages.\n\nWe have two branches: branch_a and branch_b. Each has one token: 'thinking'. \n\nSo the only word we have in both branches is 'thinking'. \n\nBut note: the token stats say that each branch has 2 tokens and the top token is 'thinking'. So there might be another token? However, the evidence only shows one inscription per branch? \n\nWait, the recent artifacts list has 4 inscriptions: 2 for branch_a and 2 for branch_b? Actually, the list has:\n  - branch_b: two inscriptions (A1770216157901 and A1770216725272)\n  - branch_a: two inscriptions (A1770216496175 and A1770216944258)\n\nBut each inscription has the same text: 'Thinking...'. So for each branch, we have two inscriptions that both say the same word? \n\nTherefore, for branch_a: two tokens (but both are the same: 'thinking')? Similarly for branch_b.\n\nSo the evidence we have is:\n\n  branch_a: [ 'thinking', 'thinking' ] -> token_count=2, top_token='thinking'\n  branch_b: [ 'thinking', 'thinking' ] -> token_count=2, top_token='thinking'\n\nThus, the only word we have in both branches is 'thinking'. \n\nWe cannot form a cognate set because we don't have multiple words. We have only one word per branch (with repetition). \n\nBut the problem says: \"similar-looking words\". We don't have any other words. \n\nSo we can only say that we have one candidate: the word 'thinking' in both branches.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for 2–5 cognate sets. Since we don't have enough data, we have to be cautious.\n\nGiven the constraints, I propose:\n\n  Cognate set 1: [ 'thinking' (branch_a), 'thinking' (branch_b) ]\n\nBut note: the problem says \"across descendant languages\". We have two branches. So we have one set of two words (both the same).\n\nBut we don't have any other words. So we cannot form more than one set.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"2–5\", so we have to say we don't have enough evidence for more.\n\nBut let's try to think: maybe the word \"thinking\" is not the only word? The token stats say token_count=2 for each branch. But the top token is 'thinking'. So the other token might be something else? But we don't have the full list. The evidence only shows the top tokens.\n\nGiven the problem, I think we have to go with what we have.\n\nTask 2: Propose up to 3 proto-root hypotheses.\n\nWe have one word that is common: 'thinking'. \n\nWe can hypothesize that the proto-language had a root for \"to think\" or \"thinking\".\n\nBut note: the word is written in the descendant languages as 'thinking'. However, the descendant languages might have different phonological and morphological structures.\n\nBut the problem says: we have imperfect evidence. \n\nWe can propose:\n\n  *thinking* = \"to think\" (low confidence)\n\nWhy low? Because we have only one word and it's the same in both branches. We don't know the meaning. The evidence says \"Thinking...\" (with an ellipsis) so it might be a verb in the present tense? But we don't have context.\n\nHowever, the problem states: the inscriptions are in the descendant languages. The word 'thinking' in English is a verb. But in the descendant languages, it might be a different form.\n\nGiven the very limited evidence, we have to be cautious.\n\nProposed roots:\n\n1. *thiŋk* = \"to think\" (confidence: low) \n   - Why? Because the descendant languages have the same word (with the same spelling in English) but we don't know the original form. The word might have been borrowed? Or it might be a direct descendant. But we have only one token.\n\n2. *sōth* = \"to think\" (confidence: very low) \n   - This is just a guess. We have no evidence for this.\n\n3. *m̥iŋk* = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"up to 3\". We have to be explicit about uncertainty.\n\nTask 3: Note 1–3 open questions.\n\nOpen questions:\n\n1. What is the exact meaning of the token 'thinking'? (We have no context for the word beyond the inscription context: tomb offering label, short prayer fragment, etc.)\n2. Are there other tokens in the descendant languages that we haven't observed? (The token stats show token_count=2 for each branch, but we don't have the full list of tokens.)\n3. How did the word \"thinking\" evolve in the descendant languages? (We have only one token, so we don't know about inflection or morphology.)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do NOT claim certainty\".\n\nLet me structure the output:\n\n# Cognate Sets\n- [1] [branch_a: 'thinking', branch_b: 'thinking'] (only one set)\n\n# Proto-Root Hypotheses\n1. *thiŋk* = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n2. *sōth* = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n3. *m̥iŋk* = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n\n# Open Questions\n1. What is the precise meaning of the descendant token 'thinking' in the context of the inscriptions?\n2. Are there additional tokens in the descendant languages that could form a more robust cognate set?\n3. How did the proto-root evolve into the descendant form 'thinking'? (Given the limited evidence, we cannot be sure of the phonological history.)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Use plain text with headings\".\n\nI'll write:\n\nCognate Sets\n- [1] branch_a: 'thinking' (token count: 2) and branch_b: 'thinking' (token count: 2)\n\nProto-Root Hypotheses\n1. *thiŋk* = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n2. *sōth* = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n3. *m̥iŋk* = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n\nOpen Questions\n1. What is the exact meaning of the token 'thinking' in the descendant languages?\n2. Are there other tokens in the descendant languages that we have not observed (beyond the top tokens) that could form additional cognate sets?\n3. What is the phonological history of the word 'thinking' from the proto-language?\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Do NOT claim certainty\". So we are being cautious.\n\nBut note: the evidence is very thin. We have only one word in both branches. So we cannot be confident in any root.\n\nLet me adjust the confidence levels: since we have only one word and it's the same in both branches, we can only be low confidence for the root.\n\nAlso, the problem says: \"Be cautious and explicit about uncertainty\".\n\nSo I'll write the output as:\n\nCognate Sets\n- [1] branch_a: 'thinking' and branch_b: 'thinking' (only one set observed)\n\nProto-Root Hypotheses\n1. *thiŋk* = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n2. *sōth* = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n3. *m̥iŋk* = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n\nOpen Questions\n1. What is the precise meaning of the token 'thinking' in the context of the inscriptions? (We have limited context: tomb offering, prayer, trade receipt, boundary marker)\n2. Are there additional tokens in the descendant languages that we have not captured in the token stats? (The token count is 2 for each branch, but we don't know the full vocabulary)\n3. How did the proto-root form evolve into the descendant form 'thinking'? (Given the single token, this is speculative)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Note 1–3 open questions\". \n\nI think this is as good as we can do.\n\nLet me write the output in plain text with headings.\n\nImportant: The problem says \"Prefer short, structured output\".\n\nSo:\n\nCognate Sets\n- [1] branch_a: 'thinking', branch_b: 'thinking'\n\nProto-Root Hypotheses\n1. *thiŋk* = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n2. *sōth* = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n3. *m̥iŋk* = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n\nOpen Questions\n1. What is the exact meaning of the token 'thinking'?\n2. Are there additional tokens beyond the top tokens?\n3. What is the phonological evolution of the word?\n\nBut note: the token is written in the evidence as 'thinking' (lowercase). We don't know if it's a verb or noun.\n\nI think this is acceptable.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"You have imperfect evidence\". So we are being cautious.\n\nLet me adjust the open questions to be more specific.\n\nFinal output:\n\nCognate Sets\n- [1] branch_a: 'thinking' (token count: 2) and branch_b: 'thinking' (token count: 2)\n\nProto-Root Hypotheses\n1. *thiŋk* = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n2. *sōth* = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n3. *m̥iŋk* = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n\nOpen Questions\n1.

How did the proto-root evolve into the descendant form 'thinking'? (Given the single token, this is highly speculative)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Do NOT claim certainty\".

We have only \"Thinking\" in branch_b.\n\n        So we cannot form a cognate set for \"not\" with branch_b.\n\n        But note: the word \"not\" might be a separate root? However, the evidence for \"not\" is only in branch_a and in the form of a negation.\n\n        We have to be cautious: the word \"not\" might be a derived form? But the problem says we have imperfect evidence.\n\n        Given the evidence, we can only see:\n\n          - The word \"thinking\" is present in both branches (with the same spelling? but note: the inscriptions are in different languages so the spelling is the same in the artifact because it's written in Latin script?).\n\n          Actually, the artifacts are written in Latin script? The problem doesn't specify the script. But the text is given as \"Thinking...\" and \"Not thinking...\". So we assume the writing system is the same for both branches? \n\n        Important: The problem says \"descendant inscriptions\". We are to reconstruct a proto-language. The inscriptions are in two branches (branch_a and branch_b) that are descendants.\n\n        The tokens we see are in English? But the problem says: \"token stats\" and the tokens are ['thinking'] and ['thinking', 'not'].\n\n        However, the context: the inscriptions are in the descendant languages. So the word \"thinking\" is a word in the descendant language? But the problem writes it in English? \n\n        Let me re-read: the artifacts have text: \"Thinking...\" and \"Not thinking...\". So the inscriptions are written in English? That doesn't seem right for a lost proto-language.\n\n        Clarification: The problem says \"reconstructing a lost proto-language from descendant inscriptions\". The inscriptions are in the descendant languages (so they are written in the descendant languages, but the problem has given the text in English?).\n\n        Actually, the problem states: \"Recent artifacts (most recent last)\" and the text is given as \"Thinking...\". This is likely a representation of the actual descendant language words. But the problem uses English to write the words? \n\n        Given the context, I think the problem is using English words to represent the descendant language words. So:\n\n          - In branch_a, the descendant language has a word for \"thinking\" (which we write as \"thinking\" in English) and also a word for \"not\" (which we write as \"not\" in English).\n\n          - In branch_b, the descendant language has a word for \"thinking\" (which we write as \"thinking\" in English) but no word for \"not\" in the evidence.\n\n        So the cognate sets:\n\n          Set 1: \n            branch_a: [thinking] \n            branch_b: [thinking]\n\n          This is one set of two languages with the same word.\n\n          Set 2: \n            branch_a: [not]   (only in branch_a, so we don't have a cognate in branch_b)\n\n          But note: the problem asks for cognate sets across descendant languages. We have two branches. So we can only form one cognate set that spans both branches? \n\n          However, the word \"not\" is only in branch_a, so it doesn't form a cognate set with branch_b.\n\n        Therefore, we have one cognate set: the word for \"thinking\" in both branches.\n\n        But wait: the problem says 2-5 possible cognate sets. We have only one set that spans both branches? \n\n        Alternatively, we might look for other words? The token stats show that branch_b has only 'thinking' and branch_a has 'thinking' and 'not'. So we don't have other tokens.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"imperfect evidence\". We might have other words that are not in the top tokens? But the evidence summary only gives top tokens.\n\n        So for now, we have:\n\n          Cognate set 1: \n            branch_a: \"thinking\"\n            branch_b: \"thinking\"\n\n        But note: the problem says \"similar-looking words\". We don't have any other words in the evidence.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"2–5 possible\". We can only say one? But let's think: the word \"thinking\" is the only word we see in both. \n\n        Alternatively, the word \"not\" might be a cognate with a root that has been lost? But we don't have evidence for it in branch_b.\n\n        So I propose:\n\n          1) Cognate set: \n               branch_a: \"thinking\" \n               branch_b: \"thinking\"\n\n          But the problem says 2-5. We have to be cautious.\n\n        Another idea: the word \"thinking\" might be a loanword? But the problem says we are reconstructing a proto-language. We assume the words are from the proto-language.\n\n        Given the evidence, I think we can only identify one cognate set.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"across descendant languages\". We have two branches. So one set.\n\n        But the problem asks for 2-5. We have to say 1? But the instruction says 2-5. So we have to say at least 2? \n\n        Let me re-read the evidence: \n\n          branch_b: token_count=4, top_tokens=['thinking'] -> so only one token: 'thinking'\n          branch_a: token_count=5, top_tokens=['thinking', 'not'] -> two tokens\n\n        So we have two tokens in branch_a. But the token 'not' does not appear in branch_b.\n\n        Therefore, we have:\n\n          Cognate set 1: \n            branch_a: \"thinking\" \n            branch_b: \"thinking\"\n\n          Cognate set 2: \n            branch_a: \"not\"   (but only in branch_a, so no cognate in branch_b)\n\n        However, a cognate set must have at least two languages? So we cannot have a set with only one language.\n\n        So we have only one cognate set that spans both branches.\n\n        But the problem says \"2–5\". We must output at least 2? \n\n        Alternatively, we might consider that the word \"thinking\" in both branches is one set, and then we have no other sets? \n\n        Given the constraints, I will output:\n\n          1) Cognate set: \n                branch_a: \"thinking\"\n                branch_b: \"thinking\"\n\n          and then note that we don't have other sets.\n\n        However, the problem says \"2–5\". So we have to be explicit about uncertainty and not claim certainty.\n\n        I think the safe approach is to say:\n\n          Possible cognate sets (1 set identified, but note evidence is limited):\n\n            * Set 1: \n                branch_a: \"thinking\"\n                branch_b: \"thinking\"\n\n          But the problem says 2-5. So we have to say at least 2? \n\n        Let me think of the word \"not\". In branch_a we have \"not\" as a token. But in branch_b, we don't have it. However, the proto-language might have had a root for negation that was lost in branch_b? \n\n        But we don't have evidence for branch_b having a negation word. So we cannot form a cognate set for \"not\" with branch_b.\n\n        Alternatively, we might consider that the word \"thinking\" in both branches is one set, and then we have the possibility of a set for a different meaning? \n\n        The problem doesn't give more tokens.\n\n        Therefore, I will output one cognate set and note that we have limited evidence.\n\n        But the problem says: \"2–5 possible\". So we have to say at least two? \n\n        I think the problem expects us to be cautious and not overstate. So I will say:\n\n          1) Cognate set: \n                branch_a: \"thinking\"\n                branch_b: \"thinking\"\n\n          and then we don't have a second set? \n\n        However, note: the problem says \"across descendant languages\". We have two branches. So the set above is the only one.\n\n        But the problem says \"2–5\". So we have to say 1? But the instruction says \"2–5\". \n\n        Given the constraints of the problem, I will output:\n\n          - 1 cognate set (with a note that evidence is limited and we don't have more)\n\n        But the problem says \"2–5\". So to be safe, I'll say:\n\n          \"1 cognate set identified (with the rest of the evidence being too sparse for additional sets)\"\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Identify 2–5 possible cognate sets\". So we have to output at least 2? \n\n        I think the problem expects us to be realistic. Let's see the instruction: \"Be cautious and explicit about uncertainty\". So we can say:\n\n          Possible cognate sets (1 set found; evidence does not support more):\n\n            Set 1: \n                branch_a: \"thinking\"\n                branch_b: \"thinking\"\n\n        But the problem says 2-5. So I will output 1 and then say that we don't have evidence for more.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the word \"thinking\" as having multiple forms? But the evidence shows the same token.\n\n        I decide:\n\n          1) Cognate set: \n                branch_a: \"thinking\"\n                branch_b: \"thinking\"\n\n        (only 1 set)\n\n 2) Propose up to 3 proto-root hypotheses.\n\n   We have the word \"thinking\" in both branches.\n\n   What could be the proto-root?\n\n   Possibilities:\n\n      a) *thiŋk = \"to think\" (high confidence? but we have only one token)\n\n      b) *thiŋ = \"to think\" (low confidence)\n\n      c) *thiŋk- (a verb root) \n\n   But note: the evidence is very limited. We don't have any other words.\n\n   Also, we have the word \"not\" in branch_a. But we don't have a cognate in branch_b. So we cannot form a root for \"not\".\n\n   However, the problem says: \"up to 3 proto-root hypotheses\". So we can propose:\n\n      Hypothesis 1: *thiŋk = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n        Why low? because we have only one token in both branches and the token is written the same way? But the writing system might be different? \n\n      Hypothesis 2: *thiŋ = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n        Why low? because we don't have a clear morphological context.\n\n      Hypothesis 3: *thiŋk- = \"to think\" (with a suffix for present tense? but we don't have context) -> confidence: very low\n\n   But note: the problem says \"be cautious and explicit about uncertainty\". So we must state the confidence.\n\n   Also, the problem says: \"Do NOT claim certainty\".\n\n   I propose:\n\n      *thiŋk = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n      *thiŋ = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n      *thiŋk- = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n\n   But wait: the token is written as \"thinking\" in both branches. This might be a verb in the present continuous? But the problem doesn't specify the grammatical form.\n\n   Given the evidence, we have to assume the word is a verb meaning \"to think\".\n\n   However, the problem says: \"imperfect evidence\". So we cannot be sure.\n\n 3) Note 1–3 open questions to investigate next.\n\n   Open questions:\n\n      a) What is the origin of the word \"not\" in branch_a? (since it's only in branch_a, it might be a later development or a loan)\n      b) Are there other words in the descendant languages that we haven't captured in the token stats? (the evidence summary only has top tokens, but there might be other words in the inscriptions)\n      c) How did the word \"thinking\" become \"thinking\" in both branches? (i.e., is it a direct inheritance or a shared innovation?)\n\n   But note: the problem says \"open questions to investigate next\". We have to be specific.\n\n   I propose:\n\n      1. How did the word for \"not\" arise in branch_a? (given it's not in branch_b, it might be a later innovation or a different root)\n      2. Are there other tokens in the inscriptions that we have not analyzed? (the token stats only show top tokens, but the inscriptions might have more words)\n      3. What is the morphological structure of \"thinking\" in the descendant languages? (to see if it's a single root or a compound)\n\n   But the problem says 1-3.\n\n   Let's write:\n\n      Open questions:\n        - The origin of the negation word in branch_a (only present in branch_a)\n        - The presence of additional tokens in the inscriptions beyond the top tokens\n        - The morphological structure of the verb \"thinking\" (is it a single root or a compound?)\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Note 1–3 open questions\"\n\n   Final output:\n\n      # Cognate Sets\n\n      * Set 1: \n          branch_a: \"thinking\"\n          branch_b: \"thinking\"\n\n      # Proto-Root Hypotheses\n\n      * thiŋk = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n      * thiŋ = \"to think\" (confidence: low)\n      * thiŋk- = \"to think\" (confidence: very low)\n\n      # Open Questions\n\n      1.
