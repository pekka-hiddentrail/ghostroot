Are there other inscriptions or artifacts in the collection that could contribute to understanding these cognate sets?\n2. Can we identify any linguistic features that distinguish these words from English counterparts?\n3. How do the cognate sets relate to the broader context of the language and its culture?",

    "summary": "## Cognate Sets and Proto-Roots\n\n**Set 1:**\n* xu, yuwa, djqd, loo, qjxswfz, yuq, xqyv\n\nThese words seem to be related to the concept of a \"mark\" or \"sign\". They are all found in inscriptions from the same culture. However, the confidence is low due to the limited number of words and the absence of contextual clues.\n\n**Set 2:**\n* gur, q, axu\n\nThese words are also associated with the concept of a \"tomb\" or \"grave\". While they are more numerous than in Set 1, they still lack contextual clues and are not sufficiently similar to warrant a high confidence score.\n\n**Set 3:**\n* thx, gur fvgzrfv, svfgurefg\n\nThese words seem to be related to the concept of offering or sacrifice. They are also found in inscriptions from the same culture, but the context is still unclear. The confidence is low due to the limited number of words and the absence of contextual clues.\n\n\n## Open Questions for Further Investigation\n\n1. How can we determine the meaning of these words without further context?\n2. Are there any other cognates or related words that could shed light on their meaning?\n3. What other linguistic features can be used to analyze these inscriptions?",
